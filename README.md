# ei_spectra_predictions

This repository contains the workflow and supporting information for "Quantum chemistry based prediction of electron ionization mass spectra for environmental chemicals".

For details on how to run the spectra prediction workflow, see this [README](/codes/README.md).

## Overview
* The [analysis](/analysis/) folder contains all resources related to the figures and tables presented in the paper.
* The [codes](/codes/) folder contains the scripts for the actual workflow to predict spectra with QCxMS using an HPC.
* The [templates](/templates) folder contains the templates which are required by the scripts to create the input files for the workflow.
* The [data](/data/) contains the simulated spectra as well as the input structures in SDF format.
